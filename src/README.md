Mandelbrot
==========

This is a renderer of the Mandelbrot set in Java.  It renders in parallel using 4 threads, rendering 3 pictures each.  Run `Main.java` to run the program.  In `ColorScheme.java` you will find a set of colors I have experimented with.  Changing the color that is active will change the way the pictures are rendered.

The code works by picking an arbitrary hardcoded point, and zooming in on that point, rendering images along the way.

View the samples directory for sample images generated by this program.  One such picture is below.
